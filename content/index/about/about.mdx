import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am currently exploring the different parts of technologies related to Machine learning and AI.

Software developer with over 4 years of experience at IBM, where I've grown from intern to full-time developer working on enterprise analytics applications used by millions. At IBM Cognos Analytics, I've focused on optimizing data processing and building user-friendly features, while collaborating across teams to improve application performance and user experience. Beyond technical development, my background in teaching and student leadership has helped me bring a well-rounded perspective to software projects, combining technical expertise with strong communication skills to deliver effective solutions.

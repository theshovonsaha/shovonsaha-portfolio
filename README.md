# Portfolio based on ReactJS, MDX, GraphQL

This portfolio showcases my work as a Software Developer, Photographer, and Videographer. Developed using Gatsby, it generates a static website that is both fast and responsive.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for a dynamic and interactive experience.
- **Gatsby**: A React-based framework that enables the creation of fast, static websites with optimized performance.
- **MDX**: Combines Markdown and JSX, allowing for rich content with React components.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that provides a more efficient and powerful alternative to REST.
- **Styled-components**: A library for styling React components using tagged template literals, enabling scoped and dynamic styles.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating animations in React, enhancing the user experience with smooth transitions.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is designed to look great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Live Demo**: You can view the live demo of my portfolio at [theshovonsaha.com](https://theshovonsaha.com).
- **Project Showcase**: Each project includes detailed descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or repositories.
